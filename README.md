## Project Description
This project is a clone of [2048](https://play2048.co/) run on the terminal. Our version is essentially the same as the originial but we have also created different variations of the game.

#### Topics Used
  - Inheritance / Interfaces
  - 2D arrays
  - Arrays
  - Iterations
  - User inputs (Scanner) 
  - Wrapper classes (Integer)
  - Strings
  - Different access modifiers
  - OOP Principles
  - ANSI escape codes

#### Cool Features
 - AI - The current AI can reach 1024 and even 2048 at times, making it decently competitive against the average user. 
 - A **variety** of other games to choose from
 - The game detects and greets the current logged in user 

#### Gamemodes
- **Classic**: Nothing special. Just the vanilla version
- **Custom Board**: 2048 with a customizable board size.
- **Restrict**: 2048 but you can only use 2 directions.
- **VSComputer**: Try to survive longer than an AI player. Try your luck with insane mode

## How-To-Launch
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/dchen278/dot_gitignore.git` in a directory of your choice
